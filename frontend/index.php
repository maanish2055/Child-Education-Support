                                                As I am the eldest among my brother and sisters I had to take care of my brothers and sister. But since we lost our parents there was no one to look afters us.
                                                But our bothers and sister from CES managed us sponsor who supported us. And now we all could go to school without any worries. Thank you CES and our sponsors. "
